#INTROduction- #The objective of this project was to develop an ML-based model that can accurately predict whether a policyholder is likely to file a car insurance claim in the next 6 months or not. The dataset used for this project contained information about the policyholder, their car, and the other information about the trigger the policyholder to file a claim such as the population density, the area cluster etc

#Methodology
#The project involved several steps, starting with data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure that the data was in the right format for the ML model. The next step was to analyze the data and identify patterns and correlations that could be used to train the ML model. Different ML algorithms were tested, such as logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests, to identify the best algorithm for the data.

#Data Mining
#The procedure employed to derive meaningful information from a larger pool of raw data involves the extraction and identification of patterns within extensive datasets, employing a combination of machine learning, statistical methods, and database systems.

#RESULT-The machine learning model demonstrated an impressive accuracy score of 93%, signifying a high level of performance in classifying policyholders for potential claims in the upcoming 6 months. The model's efficacy in accurately identifying individuals likely to file claims provides valuable insights for insurance companies, enabling them to implement proactive measures and mitigate potential losses.
